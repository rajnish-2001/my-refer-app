                types of electronic methods and sensors to collect specific data.
                Information gained from that data is used to manage assets, resources and services efficiently
                in return, that data is used to improve operations across the city.
                This includes data collected from citizens, devices, buildings and assets that is processed and analyzed
                to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, water supply networks, waste,
                criminal investigations, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.
